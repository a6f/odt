the typed parser is quadratic in input size!
more ergonomic enum generation from the typed parser
check validity of node/property names after parsing
improve reporting of warnings during evaluation
improve reporting of UTF-8 errors in fs
unittest warnings from integer truncation
fix phandle-self reference
deleting labels is quadratic; use a bimap
generate better enum variant names for typed parse tree (pest3 does not appear to fix this)
