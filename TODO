check validity of node/property names after parsing
improve reporting of warnings during evaluation
improve reporting of UTF-8 errors in fs
unittest coverage of warnings from integer truncation
fail if input uses /omit-if-no-ref/ (currently ignored so that more of dtc's test inputs could be parsed)
dtc has special behavior for the "name" property: dropped if equal to basename (node name before '@'), otherwise error
give a better "properties must precede subnodes" error message, or relax that restriction in the grammar
